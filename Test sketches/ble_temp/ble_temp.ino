/*
  BLE Temperature Updates

  This example creates a BLE peripheral with the temperature service and
  reading characteristic. Grab temperature measurements from the BME280.

  The circuit:
  - SparkFun MicroMod nRF52840 Processor Board inserted into Sparkfun MicroMod 
  Weather Carrier Board.

  You can use a generic BLE central app, like LightBlue (iOS and Android) or
  nRF Connect (Android), to interact with the services and characteristics
  created in this sketch.
